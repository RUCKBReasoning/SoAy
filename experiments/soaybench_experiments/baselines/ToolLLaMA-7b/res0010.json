Here, the challenge is to learn accurate few-shot models for classes existing at the tail of the class distribution, for which little data is available. Inspired by the rich semantic correlations between classes at the long tail and those at the head, we take advantage of the knowledge from data-rich classes at the head of the distribution to boost the performance of the data-poor classes at the tail. First, we propose to leverage implicit relational knowledge among class labels from knowledge graph embeddings and learn explicit relational knowledge using graph convolution networks. Second, we integrate that relational knowledge into relation extraction model by coarse-to-fine knowledge-aware attention mechanism. We demonstrate our results for a large-scale benchmark dataset which show that our approach significantly outperforms other baselines, especially for long-tail relations.",

        "expected_ans": "ABSTRACTSpike train classification is an important problem in many areas such as healthcare and mobile sensing, where each spike train is a high-dimensional time series of binary values. Conventional research on spike train classification mainly focus on developing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under resource-sufficient settings (e.g., on GPU servers). The neurons of the SNNs are usually densely connected in each layer. However, in many real-world applications, we often need to deploy the SNN models on resource-constrained platforms (e.g., mobile devices) to analyze high-dimensional spike train data. The high resource requirement of the densely-connected SNNs can make them hard to deploy on mobile devices. In this paper, we study the problem of energy-efficient SNNs with sparsely-connected neurons. We propose an SNN model with sparse spatio-temporal coding. Our solution is based on the re-parameterization of weights in an SNN and the application of sparsity regularization during optimization. We compare our work with the state-of-the-art SNNs and demonstrate that our sparse SNNs achieve significantly better computational efficiency on both neuromorphic and standard datasets with comparable classification accuracy. Furthermore, compared with densely-connected SNNs, we show that our method has a better capability of generalization on small-size datasets through extensive experiments.",
