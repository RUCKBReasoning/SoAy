        "expected_ans": "We investigate new approaches for frequent graph-basedpattern mining in graph datasets and propose a novel algorithmcalled gSpan (graph-based Substructure pattern mining),which discovers frequent substructures without candidategeneration. gSpan builds a new lexicographic orderamong graphs, and maps each graph to a unique minimumDFS code as its canonical label. Based on this lexico-graphicorder, gSpan adopts the depth-first search strategyto mine frequent connected subgraphs efficiently. Our performancestudy shows that gSpan substantially outperformsprevious algorithms, sometimes by an order of magnitude.",

        "expected_ans": "Existing enhancement methods are empirically expected to help the high-level end computer vision task: however, that is observed to not always be the case in practice. We focus on object or face detection in poor visibility enhancements caused by bad weathers (haze, rain) and low light conditions. To provide a more thorough examination and fair comparison, we introduce three benchmark sets collected in real-world hazy, rainy, and low-light conditions, respectively, with annotated objects/faces. We launched the UG(2+) challenge Track 2 competition in IEEE CVPR 2019, aiming to evoke a comprehensive discussion and exploration about whether and how low-level vision techniques can benefit the high-level automatic visual recognition in various scenarios. To our best knowledge, this is the first and currently largest effort of its kind. Baseline results by cascading existing enhancement and detection models are reported, indicating the highly challenging nature of our new data as well as the large room for further technical innovations. Thanks to a large participation from the research community, we are able to analyze representative team solutions, striving to better identify the strengths and limitations of existing mindsets as well as the future directions.",
