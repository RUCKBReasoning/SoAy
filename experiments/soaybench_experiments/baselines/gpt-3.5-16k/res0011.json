In 2003, a sophomore in high school, I modified a consumer digital camera and telescope to successfully detect an extra-solar planet, 150 light years away and roughly twice the size of Jupiter. Since then, my research interests have relied on the intersection of multiple disciplines including aeronautics, astrophysics, earth sciences, mechanical and electrical engineering, and optics. Presently, I serve as principal investigator for the NASA Laboratory for Advanced Sensing (LAS) as a civil servant at NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, CA. My research is directed at inventing, developing, and testing next-generation sensing technologies for NASA's Science Mission Directorate and the United States Government. My investigations aim to extend our capabilities for studying and protecting life on Earth as well as aid in the search for life elsewhere in the universe. I lead a multi-disciplinary team developing new instrumentation for underwater, airborne, and spaceborne remote sensing and communications. We validate our novel instrumentation through scientific field campaigns around the world, often in extreme environments that serve as analogs for planetary science and ocean worlds applications. Through NASA’s Technology Transfer Program, I work to ensure our NASA innovations developed for exploration and discovery are broadly available to the public, maximizing the benefit to the Nation. My team and I also develop machine learning algorithms to process big data on NASA’s Pleaides supercomputing facility. I am the inventor of fluid lensing (FluidCam) and MiDAR, the System and Method for Active Multispectral Imaging and Optical Communications, and serve as the PI for the NASA FluidCam and MiDAR instruments well as NeMO-Net project.<br><br>In 2016, I received the NASA Equal Employment Opportunity Medal in recognition of leading the LGBT group, community service and outreach, and organizing the first participation by NASA in the San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade. In 2017, I received the NASA Early Career Award in recognition of significant advances in aquatic remote sensing technology. Finally, in 2019, my MiDAR invention was awarded one of NASA’s Inventions of the Year, chosen from among thousands of new technologies within the agency, for its novelty and potential broad applications to advancing the state-of-the-art in aerospace, medicine, geology, oceanography, human spaceflight, and manufacturing.",

        "expected_ans": "In many research disciplines, hypothesis tests are applied to evaluate whether findings are statistically significant or could be explained by chance. The Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney (WMW) test is among the most popular hypothesis tests in medicine and life science to analyze if two groups of samples are equally distributed. This nonparametric statistical homogeneity test is commonly applied in molecular diagnosis. Generally, the solution of the WMW test takes a high combinatorial effort for large sample cohorts containing a significant number of ties. Hence, P value is frequently approximated by a normal distribution. We developed EDISON-WMW, a new approach to calculate the exact permutation of the two-tailed unpaired WMW test without any corrections required and allowing for ties. The method relies on dynamic programing to solve the combinatorial problem of the WMW test efficiently. Beyond a straightforward implementation of the algorithm, we presented different optimization strategies and developed a parallel solution. Using our program, the exact P value for large cohorts containing more than 1000 samples with ties can be calculated within minutes. We demonstrate the performance of this novel approach on randomly-generated data, benchmark it against 13 other commonly-applied approaches and moreover evaluate molecular biomarkers for lung carcinoma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We found that approximated P values were generally higher than the exact solution provided by EDISON-WMW. Importantly, the algorithm can also be applied to high-throughput omics datasets, where hundreds or thousands of features are included. To provide easy access to the multi-threaded version of EDISON-WMW, a web-based solution of our algorithm is freely available at http://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/software/wtest/.",
