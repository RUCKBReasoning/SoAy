Here we introduce a model of synaptic plasticity based on data-constrained postsynaptic calcium dynamics, and show in a neocortical microcircuit model that a single parameter set is sufficient to unify the available experimental findings on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of PC connections. In particular, we find that the diverse plasticity outcomes across the different PC types can be explained by cell-type-specific synaptic physiology, cell morphology and innervation patterns, without requiring type-specific plasticity. Generalizing the model to in vivo extracellular calcium concentrations, we predict qualitatively different plasticity dynamics from those observed in vitro. This work provides a first comprehensive null model for LTP/LTD between neocortical PC types in vivo, and an open framework for further developing models of cortical synaptic plasticity.

When impinging on its early phase, individual inhibitory synapses strongly, but transiently, dampen the NMDA spike; later inhibition prematurely terminates it. A single inhibitory synapse reduces the NMDA-mediated Ca2+ current, a key player in plasticity, by up to 45%. NMDA spikes in distal dendritic branches/spines are longer-lasting and more resilient to inhibition, enhancing synaptic plasticity at these branches.

One such key mechanism is the Ca2+ spike at the apical tuft of pyramidal neurons. Characterized by a plateau potential sustained for tens of milliseconds, the Ca2+ spike amplifies excitatory input, facilitates somatic action potentials (APs), and promotes synaptic plasticity. Despite its essential role, the mechanisms regulating it are largely unknown. Using a compartmental model of a layer 5 pyramidal cell (L5PC), we explored the plateau and termination phases of the Ca2+ spike under input current perturbations, long-step current-injections, and variations in the dendritic high-voltage-activated Ca2+ conductance (that occur during cholinergic modulation). We found that, surprisingly, timed excitatory input can shorten the Ca2+ spike duration while inhibitory input can either elongate or terminate it. A significant elongation also occurs when the high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (CaHVA) conductance is increased. To mechanistically understand these phenomena, we analyzed the currents involved in the spike. The plateau and termination phases are almost exclusively controlled by the CaHVA inward current and the Im outward K+ current. We reduced the full model to a single-compartment model that faithfully preserved the responses of the Ca2+ spike to interventions and consisted of two dynamic variables: the membrane potential and the K+-channel activation level. A phase-plane analysis of the reduced model provides testable predictions for modulating the Ca2+ spike and reveals various dynamical regimes that explain the robust nature of the spike. Regulating the duration of the Ca2+ spike significantly impacts the cell synaptic-plasticity window and, as we show, its input-output relationship.", "author_list": [{"person_id": "6403d740adc7183bcb799698", "name": "Amir Dudai"}, {"person_id": "5d415bf47390bff0db70b37d", "name": "Michael Doron"}, {"person_id": "53f4574ddabfaeb22f504899", "name": "Idan Segev"}, {"person_id": "5610a04345ce1e596230b185", "name": "Michael London"}], "num_citation": 3, "year": 2022, "pdf_link": "unknown", "venue": {"info": {"name": "JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE"}, "issue": "7", "volume": "42"}}, {"abstract": "The thalamus is the main gateway for sensory information from the periphery to the mammalian cerebral cortex.

{"route": "searchPerson -> getPersonPubs -> getPublication", "result": "In talent recruitment, the job interview aims at selecting the right candidates for the right jobs through assessing their skills and experiences in relation to the job positions. While tremendous efforts have been made in improving job interviews, a long-standing challenge is how to design appropriate interview questions for comprehensively assessing the competencies that may be deemed relevant and representative for person-job fit. To this end, in this research, we focus on the development of a personalized question recommender system, namely DuerQuiz, for enhancing the job interview assessment. DuerQuiz is a fully deployed system, in which a knowledge graph of job skills, Skill-Graph, has been built for comprehensively modeling the relevant competencies that should be assessed in the job interview. Specifically, we first develop a novel skill entity extraction approach based on a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer (LSTM-CRF) neural network enhanced with adapted gate mechanism. In particular, to improve the reliability of extracted skill entities, we design a label propagation method based on more than 10 billion click-through data from the large-scale Baidu query logs. Furthermore, we discover the hypernym-hyponym relations between skill entities and construct the Skill-Graph by leveraging the classifier trained with extensive contextual features. Finally, we design a personalized question recommendation algorithm based on the Skill-Graph for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of job interview assessment. Extensive experiments on real-world recruitment data clearly validate the effectiveness of DuerQuiz, which had been deployed for generating written exercises in the 2018 Baidu campus recruitment event and received remarkable performances in terms of efficiency and effectiveness for selecting outstanding talents compared with a traditional non-personalized human-only assessment approach.\n\n", "exe_time": 40.14348125457764}
