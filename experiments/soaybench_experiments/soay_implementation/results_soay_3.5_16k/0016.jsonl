In this paper, we address this concern with a two-stage privacy-preserving scheme called RG-RP: the first stage is designed to mitigate maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation attacks by perturbing each participant's data through a nonlinear function called repeated Gompertz (RG); while the second stage aims to maintain accuracy and reduce transmission energy by projecting high-dimensional data to a lower dimension, using a row-orthogonal random projection (RP) matrix. The proposed RG-RP scheme delivers better recovery resistance to MAP estimation attacks than most state-of-the-art techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets. For collaborative learning, we proposed a novel LSTM-CNN model combining the merits of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our experiments on two representative movement datasets captured by wearable sensors demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-CNN model outperforms standalone LSTM, CNN and Deep Belief Network. Together, RG+RP and LSTM-CNN provide a privacy-preserving collaborative learning framework that is both accurate and privacy-preserving.\n\n", "author_list": [{"person_id": "53f44cc2dabfaeecd69c6406", "name": "Lingjuan Lyu"}, {"person_id": "53f32dd6dabfae9a8449ccd8", "name": "Xuanli He"}, {"person_id": "53f39a51dabfae4b34a8e5dc", "name": "Yee Wei Law"}, {"person_id": "53f56335dabfae5e4af8045b", "name": "Marimuthu Palaniswami"}], "num_citation": 56, "year": 2017, "pdf_link": "https://cz5waila03cyo0tux1owpyofgoryroob.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/FA/17/BB/FA17BB821328E63DA6CBFAECBE3A440C.pdf", "venue": {"id": "53a72c0f20f7420be8c3872f", "info": {"name": "CIKM"}, "issue": "", "type": 10, "volume": ""}}, {"abstract": "Dealing with the complex word forms in morphologically rich languages is an open problem in language processing, and is particularly important in translation.

To counter these problems, in this paper we build a Fog-embedded privacy-preserving deep learning framework (FPPDL), which moves computation from the centralized Cloud to Fog nodes near the end devices. The experimental results on benchmark image datasets under different settings demonstrate that FPPDL achieves comparable accuracy to the centralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) framework, and delivers better accuracy than the standalone SGD framework.

Thus, NLG APIs have already become essential profitable services in many commercial companies. Due to the substantial financial and intellectual investments, service providers adopt a pay-as-you-use policy to promote sustainable market growth. However, recent works have shown that cloud platforms suffer from financial losses imposed by model extraction attacks, which aim to imitate the functionality and utility of the victim services, thus violating the intellectual property (IP) of cloud APIs. This work targets at protecting IP of NLG APIs by identifying the attackers who have utilized watermarked responses from the victim NLG APIs. However, most existing watermarking techniques are not directly amenable for IP protection of NLG APIs. To bridge this gap, we first present a novel watermarking method for text generation APIs by conducting lexical modification to the original outputs. Compared with the competitive baselines, our watermark approach achieves better identifiable performance in terms of p-value, with fewer semantic losses. In addition, our watermarks are more understandable and intuitive to humans than the baselines. Finally, the empirical studies show our approach is also applicable to queries from different domains, and is effective on the attacker trained on a mixture of the corpus which includes less than 10% watermarked samples.", "author_list": [{"person_id": "53f32dd6dabfae9a8449ccd8", "name": "Xuanli He"}, {"person_id": "53f45b01dabfaee0d9c053d9", "name": "Qiongkai Xu"}, {"person_id": "53f44cc2dabfaeecd69c6406", "name": "Lingjuan Lyu"}, {"person_id": "53f4728bdabfaee02adc4654", "name": "Fangzhao Wu"}, {"person_id": "542a716fdabfae646d562c9f", "name": "Chenguang Wang"}], "num_citation": 35, "year": 2022, "pdf_link": "https://static.aminer.cn/storage/pdf/arxiv/21/2112/2112.02701.pdf", "venue": {"info": {"name": "AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "name_s": "AAAI", "publisher": "dblp"}, "lang": "en", "type": 2, "volume": "abs/2112.02701"}}, {"abstract": "paper abstract", "author_list": [{"person_id": "53f32dd6dabfae9a8449ccd8", "name": "Xuanli He"}, {"person_id": "53f46cdddabfaee2a1dc8a13", "name": "Gholamreza Haffari"}, {"person_id": "53f3a0acdabfae4b34ab810b", "name": "Mohammad Norouzi 0002"}], "num_citation": 34, "year": 2020, "pdf_link": "unknown", "venue": {"info": {"name": "CoRR"}, "volume": "abs/2005.06606"}}, {"abstract": "Most deep learning frameworks require users to pool their local data or model updates to a trusted server to train or maintain a global model.

To provide a more thorough examination and fair comparison, we introduce three benchmark sets collected in real-world hazy, rainy, and low-light conditions, respectively, with annotated objects/faces. We launched the UG(2+) challenge Track 2 competition in IEEE CVPR 2019, aiming to evoke a comprehensive discussion and exploration about whether and how low-level vision techniques can benefit the high-level automatic visual recognition in various scenarios. To our best knowledge, this is the first and currently largest effort of its kind. Baseline results by cascading existing enhancement and detection models are reported, indicating the highly challenging nature of our new data as well as the large room for further technical innovations. Thanks to a large participation from the research community, we are able to analyze representative team solutions, striving to better identify the strengths and limitations of existing mindsets as well as the future directions.", "exe_time": 7.232763290405273}
