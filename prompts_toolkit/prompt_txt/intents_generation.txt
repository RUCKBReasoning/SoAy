Your task is to generate questions. 
Specifically, generate corresponding questions that can be solved based on the given function combination and input/output. 
In the generated questions, replace institutional information with X, field or interest information with XX, and personal name information with XXX. 
For example, given the function combination searchPerson -> getCoauthors, 
the specific information about the involved functions is: 
{"function_name" : "searchPerson", "function_type" : "fuzzy", "parameters" : ["name", "organization", "interest"], "return" : ["person_id", "name", "num_citation", "interest", "num_pubs", "organization"]} 
{"function_name" : "getCoauthors", "function_type" : "exact", "parameters" : ["person_id"], "return" : ["person_id", "name", "relation"]} 
The meaning of this combination is to obtain the person_id through the searchPerson function first, and then input the person_id into getCoauthors to get the output. 
In a combination, the first function is called the head function, and the last API is called the tail function. 
The input of the head function and the output of the tail function determine the meaning of the question that this combination can solve. 
For example, in this searchPerson -> getCoauthors example, when the input of the head function is name, organization; and the output of the tail function is name, the corresponding question is: 
Who are the collaborators of XXX at X organization? 
If the input of the head function is name, interest; and the output of the tail function is name, the corresponding question is: 
Who are the collaborators of XXX in the field of XX? 

Based on the above hints and the provided function combination, relevant function description, given head function input, and given tail function output, generate the corresponding question. End with \n-----\n after generating.
Function combination: searchPerson -> getCoauthors -> searchPerson

Relevant function description: 
{"function_name" : "searchPerson", "function_type" : "fuzzy", "parameters" : ["name", "organization", "interest"], "return" : ["person_id", "name", "num_citation", "interest", "num_pubs", "organization"]} 
{"function_name" : "getCoauthors", "function_type" : "exact", "parameters" : ["person_id"], "return" : ["person_id", "name", "relation"]}

Head function input: 
name, organization

Tail function output: 
num_citation
