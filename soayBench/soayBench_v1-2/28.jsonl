On the other hand, I have been passionate about programming for 7 years. It all began with a side project which is now a live mobile application: MisterGoodBeer. Then, I discovered machine learning which I enjoy using, in combination with programming, to extract knowledge from data. When existing methods don’t provide satisfying results, I find it thrilling to dive in and deeply understand the algorithms to mix or adapt them. It also is important for me to produce clean, reusable and easy to share code. Additionally, I take satisfaction in polishing my algorithms with precise low-level optimizations to achieve better performances.", "Base_Question_zh": "XX领域的XXX的简介？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the introduction of XXX in XX field?", "Inputs": "name, interest", "Outputs": "bio", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Martin Bompaire", "organization": "Criteo", "interest": "Hawkes Processes"}}
