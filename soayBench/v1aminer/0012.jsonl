{"Query": "Google Research的Yang Li的代表作的摘要是？", "Answer": "Although mobile, tablet, large display, and tabletop computers increasingly present opportunities for using pen, finger, and wand gestures in user interfaces, implementing gesture recognition largely has been the privilege of pattern matching experts, not user interface prototypers. Although some user interface libraries and toolkits offer gesture recognizers, such infrastructure is often unavailable in design-oriented environments like Flash, scripting environments like JavaScript, or brand new off-desktop prototyping environments. To enable novice programmers to incorporate gestures into their UI prototypes, we present a \"$1 recognizer\" that is easy, cheap, and usable almost anywhere in about 100 lines of code. In a study comparing our $1 recognizer, Dynamic Time Warping, and the Rubine classifier on user-supplied gestures, we found that $1 obtains over 97% accuracy with only 1 loaded template and 99% accuracy with 3+ loaded templates. These results were nearly identical to DTW and superior to Rubine. In addition, we found that medium-speed gestures, in which users balanced speed and accuracy, were recognized better than slow or fast gestures for all three recognizers. We also discuss the effect that the number of templates or training examples has on recognition, the score falloff along recognizers' N-best lists, and results for individual gestures. We include detailed pseudocode of the $1 recognizer to aid development, inspection, extension, and testing.", "Base_Question_zh": "X机构的XXX的代表作的摘要是？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the abstract of the representative work of XXX at X institution?", "Inputs": "name, organization", "Outputs": "abstract", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Yang Li", "organization": "Google Research", "interest": "User Interface"}, "Query_EN": "What is the abstract of the representative work of Yang Li from Google Research?"}

{"Query": "信息检索领域的Xu Yu的代表作的摘要是？", "Answer": "The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices in a large graph into different clusters based on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity. Graph clustering techniques are very useful for detecting densely connected groups in a large graph. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topological structure for clustering, but largely ignore the vertex properties which are often heterogenous. In this paper, we propose a novel graph clustering algorithm, SA-Cluster, based on both structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. Our method partitions a large graph associated with attributes into k clusters so that each cluster contains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. An effective method is proposed to automatically learn the degree of contributions of structural similarity and attribute similarity. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that SA-Cluster is converging. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SA-Cluster through comparison with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and summarization methods.", "Base_Question_zh": "X领域的XXX的代表作的摘要是？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the abstract of the representative work of XXX in X field?", "Inputs": "name, interest", "Outputs": "abstract", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Xu Yu", "organization": "Tencent", "interest": "Information Retrieval"}, "Query_EN": "What is the abstract of the representative work of Xu Yu in the Information Retrieval field?"}
