{"Query": "Convolutional Neural Network领域的Huan Wang的代表作的摘要是？", "Answer": "Existing enhancement methods are empirically expected to help the high-level end computer vision task: however, that is observed to not always be the case in practice. We focus on object or face detection in poor visibility enhancements caused by bad weathers (haze, rain) and low light conditions. To provide a more thorough examination and fair comparison, we introduce three benchmark sets collected in real-world hazy, rainy, and low-light conditions, respectively, with annotated objects/faces. We launched the UG(2+) challenge Track 2 competition in IEEE CVPR 2019, aiming to evoke a comprehensive discussion and exploration about whether and how low-level vision techniques can benefit the high-level automatic visual recognition in various scenarios. To our best knowledge, this is the first and currently largest effort of its kind. Baseline results by cascading existing enhancement and detection models are reported, indicating the highly challenging nature of our new data as well as the large room for further technical innovations. Thanks to a large participation from the research community, we are able to analyze representative team solutions, striving to better identify the strengths and limitations of existing mindsets as well as the future directions.", "Base_Question_zh": "X领域的XXX的代表作的摘要是？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the abstract of the representative work of XXX in X field?", "Inputs": "name, interest", "Outputs": "abstract", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Huan Wang", "organization": "SMILE Lab, Northeastern University", "interest": "Convolutional Neural Network"}, "Query_EN": "What is the abstract of the representative works of Huan Wang in the field of Convolutional Neural Network?"}
