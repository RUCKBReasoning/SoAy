In addition, it is investigated whether the values of the parameters obtained from fits to UE observables are consistent with the values determined from fitting observables sensitive to double-parton scattering processes. Finally, comparisons are presented of the UE tunes to \"minimum bias\" (MB) events, multijet, and Drell-Yan ([Formula: see text] lepton-antilepton+jets) observables at 7 and 8[Formula: see text], as well as predictions for MB and UE observables at 13[Formula: see text].", "Base_Question_zh": "X领域的XXX的代表作的摘要是？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the abstract of the representative work of XXX in X field?", "Inputs": "name, interest", "Outputs": "abstract", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Alexey Svyatkovskiy", "organization": "Microsoft", "interest": "Spark Graphframes"}, "Query_EN": "What is the abstract of the representative work of Alexey Svyatkovskiy in the field of Spark Graphframes?"}
