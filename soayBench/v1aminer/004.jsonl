Building on continued growth and success, in June 2014, he had initiated the creation of an interdisciplinary Data Science Institute at BU which he had also been asked to lead.\n\nOver the last 20 years, Prof. Gabrys has been working at various universities and research and development departments of commercial institutions based in three different countries, which allowed him to establish a wide network of links and collaborations with various commercial organizations and research groups within UK and abroad. Since accepting his first independent academic position his research activities have concentrated on the areas of data science, complex adaptive systems, computational intelligence, machine learning, predictive analytics and their diverse applications. In particular, he has pursued the development of various statistical, machine learning, nature inspired and hybrid intelligent techniques especially targeting data and information fusion, learning and adaptive methods, multiple classifier and prediction systems, processing and modelling of uncertainty in pattern recognition, diagnostic analysis and decision support systems.\n\nProf. Gabrys is supervising a number of PhD research students and is currently actively involved in various funded research projects. He has published over 140 research papers, reviewed for various journals, edited books and special issues of journals, chaired conferences, workshops and special sessions and been on programme committees of a large number of international conferences with the Data Science, Computational Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Mining themes. He is frequently invited to give keynote and plenary talks at international conferences and lectures at internationally leading research centres and commercial research labs.\n\nProf. Gabrys recently co-ordinated an EU funded INFER project. He is also the Chair, Academic Affairs of KES International, a Co-Editor in Chief of the International Journal of Knowledge Based & Intelligent Engineering Systems, and, among others, was a co-chair of a very successful KES’2006 conference.\n\nProf. Gabrys was a co-chairman of the Nature-inspired Data Technology focus group within the EU Coordination Action project on Nature-inspired Smart Information Systems (NiSIS). He was also a corresponding person for a Key Node in the European Network on Intelligent Technologies for Smart Adaptive Systems (EUNITE) and a co-chairman of the Research Theory & Development Group on Integration of Methods.\n\nHe is a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a Memebr of IEEE Computational Intelligence Society and a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (HEA).", "Base_Question_zh": "X机构的XXX的教育经历是？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the educational background of XXX at X institution?", "Inputs": "name, organization", "Outputs": "education_experience", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Bogdan Gabrys", "organization": "Faculty of Engineering and IT,University of Technology Sydney", "interest": "Machine Learning"}, "Query_EN": "What is the educational background of Bogdan Gabrys from the Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Technology Sydney?"}

{"Query": "Data Mining领域的Fei Wang的代表作的摘要是？", "Answer": "Gaining knowledge and actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional and heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key challenge in transforming health care. Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human interpretability.", "Base_Question_zh": "X领域的XXX的代表作的摘要是？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the abstract of the representative work of XXX in X field?", "Inputs": "name, interest", "Outputs": "abstract", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Fei Wang", "organization": "Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University", "interest": "Data Mining"}, "Query_EN": "What is the abstract of Fei Wang's representative work in the Data Mining field?"}
