{"Query": "4Paradigm的Mengshuo Wang的代表作的摘要是？", "Answer": "Machine learning techniques have deeply rooted in our everyday life. However, since it is knowledge- and labor-intensive to pursue good learning performance, human experts are heavily involved in every aspect of machine learning. In order to make machine learning techniques easier to apply and reduce the demand for experienced human experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a hot topic with both industrial and academic interest. In this paper, we provide an up to date survey on AutoML. First, we introduce and define the AutoML problem, with inspiration from both realms of automation and machine learning. Then, we propose a general AutoML framework that not only covers most existing approaches to date but also can guide the design for new methods. Subsequently, we categorize and review the existing works from two aspects, i.e., the problem setup and the employed techniques. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of AutoML approaches and explain the reasons underneath their successful applications. We hope this survey can serve as not only an insightful guideline for AutoML beginners but also an inspiration for future research.", "Base_Question_zh": "X机构的XXX的代表作的摘要是？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the abstract of the representative work of XXX at X institution?", "Inputs": "name, organization", "Outputs": "abstract", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Mengshuo Wang", "organization": "4Paradigm", "interest": "Computational Modeling"}, "Query_EN": "What is the abstract of Mengshuo Wang's signature work at 4Paradigm?"}

{"Query": "Feature Selection领域的Brian Liu的代表作的摘要是？", "Answer": "ABSTRACTTree ensembles distribute feature importance evenly amongst groups of correlated features. The average feature ranking of the correlated group is suppressed, which reduces interpretability and complicates feature selection. In this paper we present ControlBurn, a feature selection algorithm that uses a weighted LASSO-based feature selection method to prune unnecessary features from tree ensembles, just as low-intensity fire reduces overgrown vegetation. Like the linear LASSO, ControlBurn assigns all the feature importance of a correlated group of features to a single feature. Moreover, the algorithm is efficient and only requires a single training iteration to run, unlike iterative wrapper-based feature selection methods. We show that ControlBurn performs substantially better than feature selection methods with comparable computational costs on datasets with correlated features.", "Base_Question_zh": "X领域的XXX的代表作的摘要是？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the abstract of the representative work of XXX in X field?", "Inputs": "name, interest", "Outputs": "abstract", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Brian Liu", "organization": "Microsoft", "interest": "Feature Selection"}, "Query_EN": "What is the abstract of Brian Liu's signature work in the field of Feature Selection?"}
