{"Query": "School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University的Asaf Cassel的代表作的摘要是？", "Answer": "Different risk-related criteria have received recent interest in learning problems, where typically each case is treated in a customized manner. In this paper we provide a more systematic approach to analyzing such risk criteria within a stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulation. We identify a set of general conditions that yield a simple characterization of the oracle rule (which serves as the regret benchmark), and facilitate the design of upper confidence bound (UCB) learning policies. The conditions are derived from problem primitives, primarily focusing on the relation between the arm reward distributions and the (risk criteria) performance metric. Among other things, the work highlights some (possibly non-intuitive) subtleties that differentiate various criteria in conjunction with statistical properties of the arms. Our main findings are illustrated on several widely used objectives such as conditional value-at-risk, mean-variance, Sharpe-ratio, and more.", "Base_Question_zh": "X机构的XXX的代表作的摘要是？", "Base_Question_en": "What is the abstract of the representative work of XXX at X institution?", "Inputs": "name, organization", "Outputs": "abstract", "Entity_Information": {"name": "Asaf Cassel", "organization": "School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University", "interest": "Linear Control"}, "Query_EN": "What is the abstract of the representative work of Asaf Cassel from School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University?"}

Recently, GCNs and subsequent variants have shown superior performance in various application areas on real-world datasets. Despite their success, most of the current GCN models are shallow, due to the {\\em over-smoothing} problem. In this paper, we study the problem of designing and analyzing deep graph convolutional networks. We propose the GCNII, an extension of the vanilla GCN model with two simple yet effective techniques: {\\em Initial residual} and {\\em Identity mapping}. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the two techniques effectively relieves the problem of over-smoothing. Our experiments show that the deep GCNII model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various semi- and full-supervised tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/chennnM/GCNII .
